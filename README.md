# configs to ignore
i was trying to get dwmblocks to render some colors with shell scripts but i've failed terribly  <Br>
then naturally, i decided the logical next step to waste time was to re-structure my entire dotfiles directory and make it more "organized" so my heart feels content <Br>
i really need better hobbies bro smh <Br>
but yeah my dwmblocks configs are broken so i'd suggest not to play with them
